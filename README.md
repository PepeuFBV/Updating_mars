# Mars Software Modification for MIPS Architecture - Updating Mars

## Project Description

This project is a modification of the Mars software for the MIPS architecture. The implementation corresponds to part of the operating system infrastructure to perform process management, such as creation of Syscalls, PCB, and process scheduling.

## Getting Started

These instructions will provide a copy of the project running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What you need to install the software:

- Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 8 or higher
- Mars MIPS Simulator

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project folder
3. Compile the project

## Running the tests

To run the tests, you need to open the Mars MIPS Simulator and load the project file. Then, you can run created Syscalls etc etc --TODO
